    <h1>Instructions</h1>

    <p>In this experiment, you will watch a joystick move a cube in several directions, and turn different lights off. Try and remember which directions turn which lights off. When that is complete, you will be asked to turn the same lights off. Try and recall the mappings you saw to the best of your ability. Whenever you reach the end of a track, however, the light will turn off, regardless of whether you went to the correct direction.</p>
